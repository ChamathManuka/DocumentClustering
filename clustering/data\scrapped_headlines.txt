Budget carrier Mihin Lanka will be scrapped next month while the deadline for the Expression of Interest (EOI) seeking a new management partner for SriLankan Airlines has been extended till September 23, its chairman Ajith Dias said on Wednesday.  The date for the submission of the proposals has been further extended from end-August to accommodate more EOIs, Mr. Dias said.  Noting the urgency of SriLankan?s crisis, its chairman said that the carrier needed an international partner ?which is very useful. Hopefully they will come with money as we have a carry forward debt and the government cannot continue to subsides all the time.?  SriLankan Airlines has reduced its losses by 29 per cent while its operating losses have improved by 70 per cent, Mr. Dias said.  The airline would accrue further losses amounting to US$49.5 million during the airport day-closure from January to April next year. In the meantime all airlines are set to have a 15 per cent reduction in seat capacity, he said.  Speaking to journalists at the opening of its new global 24-hour call centre in Kollupitiya under a new partner and location, the chairman explained that the country?s budget carrier Mihin Lanka would be taken over by the airline around October.  The plan would be to take over Mihin Lanka?s aircraft as well that would be re-branded as SriLankan Airlines and marketed at a different price scale, Mr. Dias explained.  The airline currently has four aircraft that would be reduced to three by the time of the take over as one aircraft is being taken over by the leased party.  A second aircraft would be returned to the lessor in January leaving only two aircraft to be carried over by SriLankan Airlines.  Plans are being worked out to ensure that the pilgrim traffic sectors like Varnasi (India) would be priced differently with a slight increase in its existing Mihin Lanka rates, Mr. Dias said.  But other sectors would continue but rates would be slightly less than SriLankan Airline?s flights, the chairman said.  Meanwhile, the Global Contact Centre which opened this morning has partnered with a Malaysian based company SciCom that works with several other airlines as well and which would only that would be able to cater to all calls coming into the airline on a 24-hour basis in Sinhala, Tamil, English and Mandarin within two to 60 seconds.

The Government has invited Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), offering, among other things, exemptions from exchange control regulations to any prospective investor.The closing date for submission of EOIs was initially fixed for August 12 but has now been extended till August 26, 2016.  A briefing visit to the location is to take place on the afternoon of August 18. Other incentives offered include tax holidays and long-term lease options.The Government has struggled to put the ailing airport to use, even implementing an open skies policy in April 2015.  This gave international operators all nine ?freedoms of the air?, including the liberty to use the airport as a base for commercial airline operations. But it did little to attract foreign interest.In an advertisement published on the website of the Airport and Aviation Services Ltd website, the Ministry of Transport and Aviation has invited EOIs from national and international entrepreneurs for investments and commercial operations of MRIA. The aerodrome facility consists of a 3,500m x 60m runway, apron, taxiways and passenger cargo terminal. MRIA is a 24-hour, full-service operational airport that can accommodate the world?s biggest cargo and passenger aircrafts.MRIA is publicized as being strategically located, just 30km from the Hambantota deep water seaport. It is said to be in close proximity to major tourism hotspots with domestic air taxi connectivity between two international and 14 domestic airports. It has also been declared a specified bonded area and free trade zone.

politics and had no legal basis he further went onto claim that the previous rajapaksa regime had him abducted with the intention of killing him but had been forced to back down and release him due to pressure from various quarters both nationally and internationallyfollowing is the full statement made by mr gunaratnam as appearing in a release made available by the flsphonourable judgebeing a person born in this town kegalle as if a foreigner i am accused for overstaying tourist visawhen i go to the front of my home i can see the public cemetery where the remains of my father and many more relatives are buried behind the house stretches the colombokandy road beside which is the roman catholic cemetery where the remains of the relatives of my grandfather buried and the tomb stones are still there when i walk up the kegalle hill along the colombo kandy road on my left i can see the st marys college where i myself and my brother as well as my uncles studied on the other side is the kegalle st joseph balika where my mother and my sisters studiedso having arrested at my house in my hometown police has charged me as if a foreigner for not bearing valid visa this i believe is a result of the anti democratic nature of our country allow me to explain the background in which this kind of accusation is held against mehonourable judgei entered the politics in when i was studying at pinnawala central college then i was an advanced level student i was enrolled to the engineering faculty of peradeniya university and my engagement in politics left politics continued i have intentionally made my career as leftist professional revolutionary from that time till now i have being doing the same the background which i entered the leftist politics has a correlations to the charges leveled at me today the question my citizenship or my rights to engage in politics here is a question of democracy of this country the time i entered the leftist politics and when i continued my political career was a time which the democracy of this country was threatened by prevailing political powerin united national party came to power lead by jr jayawardhane he introduced the executive presidency we explain it as a regime of repressive political power that repressive government crushed down the july strike in was the infamous election of development councils in which reported the large scale election malpractices by government goons jr jayawardhana government did a greater crime by postponing the general election to be held in the mandate given in general election was reused to stay in power for another years so it was not only anti democratic regime but also an illegal one it was the same regime responsible for pushing the country in to a racist war by creating the communal violence named as black july making use of the black july jr proscribed jvp the party in which i was active in the leftist politics the proscription was an excuse for the anti democratic regime to hunt down the comrades engaged in leftist politics along with me arrested tortured and most of the time brutally murdered they were the victims of jrs repressive power this was the sociopolitical background where i decided to enter in the leftist politicsso in such a background my political activities in the leftist politics are connected to the political struggle for restoring democratic rights we know that the country was fallen into a civil war situation during the period on one side the war in the north worsened and in south anti democratic powers of unp government was challenged by the leftist movement where i was actively engaged in during that time male and female comrades of our party were abducted and tortured and the leaders including rohana wijeweera upatissa gamanayaka were murdered until now there have been no investigations or commissions nor inquiries neither any judicial actions to make justice for those comrades so as i said before my ancestral relatives are buried her e in known cemeteries but the remains of my comrades including my elder brother ranjithan are scattered unknown all over this country the anti democratic regime grabbed away my brother from me my family and my political country even i could salvage myself the fate of comrade bandula dissanayake who studied with me in the university and who attempted to save my life is not known this is the environment where i was engaged in leftist politics and later accused of overstaying visaplease let me explain the reasons of going abroad and obtaining citizenship in another country having crushed to ground and burnt to ashes i myself and few others took a decision to reestablish the leftist political movement and hoist the red flag in this land when the leftist politics is more and more discouraged speaking according to the marxist point of view the capitalist political regimes are not capable to solving the crisis of social political and cultural problems in this country it is unable to defeat communal politics as well as the social inequality soviet union was fallen and the leftist movement was discouraged resulting many more drawbacks for the revoking of the leftist politics in this land but the philosophical and logical faith on resolving these problems we were motivated to restore the political movement the jvp back in politics also our conscience of becoming the noncompromising revolutionaries and that of departed comrades during the repression of unp regime enabled us to be strong in making our attempt successful senadheera gunatilaka the current general secretary of frontline socialist party late comrade kamal deshapriya or senevi and myself were among the few who initiated the attempt from that day till september we engaged in all kind of activities in that political partyin we decided to compete in the general election and to reenter the mainstream politics in this country then in local councils election presidential election and general elections we were active among the leftist political movement then in we were active in creating an alliance government and in presidential election we supported mahinda rajapaksha to become the president i was an active member of initial organizing committee of and later in the political bureau responsible for decision making of jvp i summarize these in order to elaborate the reasons why i was compelled to leave the country and subsequently live in exile after creating the upfa government an internal debate commenced in the party to evaluate whether our decision to support capitalist parties is worthwhile it was a time of crisis for the party then after mahinda rajapaksha was victorious with the support by us some of our party members wanted to join his government a majority of our party central committee were not in favour of the idea however few members left the party and joined the rajapaksha regime not only that those who deserted the party have described that it was me who campaign in the party against joining the government this was a turning point of our well disciplined leftist revolutionary culture and a sign of falling into backward politics as a result of this i was a specific target of the repression of rajapaksha regime this was the main reason for my leaving the country the decision to leave the country was taken by the party and i left the country in with my familyso honourable judgemy leaving of the country and my politics has an unalienable connection it is now evident that the reason for accusing me on overstaying visa has clear political reasons the life threat against me was proved when i was abducted by an unknown armed gang on the th of april i was abducted by a group of armed men assigned by rajapaksha regime and they have intentions to take my life there was widespread protest among the civil rights organizations political parties media organizations in local and international level this quick and massive response compelled rajapaksha regime to spare my life and release me this was a rare escape during the repression by rajapaksha regimeyour honour someone may argue how an internal debate or dispute or even a partys decision making affect the society as a whole honour judge i believe that decisions taken by a political party are decisive for the fate of a society destruction or well being of that country for an example recent decisions taken by jvp have affected the society the history in making and the fate of citizens i can highlight that the decisions of jvp to establish upfa government was decisive such decisions may result in success or failure but my point is those decisions are important for the life and society when we go back to there may be criticism decisions of a party are decisive after some of our then colleagues joined with the rajapaksha regime they abandoned their leftist mentality and political prospects it is apparent in their activities in the capitalist politics even they deserted the party the internal political debate continued in party i had to return to the island to join in the party activities and to engage in political activities several times in september i returned to country as a response to requests by my comrades to associate with the ongoing debate towards an unrest inside the party i returned to country on rd of september despite of a life threatbeing a marxist and a communist who believe socialism is the alternative for many more problems of this society a revolutionary have to take the risk i returned to the island to mediate with the ongoing debate and to manage it to the extent that no harm done to the political movement but that was not the result and we had to rebuild a newleftist movement frontline socialist party in the meantime a barrage of slander was thrown at our new left movement using the state and private media there was suspicion aroused relating our politics with ltte and diaspora tamils in order to suppress us the attractive nature of those allegations your honour is the deserters of jvp and the then leaders of jvp were in same line spreading malicious propaganda against us there was evidence that state intelligence services were alerted about a possible armed insurrection by the new born political party the objective was to annihilate the new left movement at its initial steps by means of the false propaganda these elements wanted our party alienated from general public they used my tamil identity to deviate masses from our party and to create environment to suppress us by violent meanson the th of december our party was preparing to hold a media conference and two comrades of our party lalith kumar and kuhan murugananthan were abducted still they are missing it was in may the war concluded and the north and east provinces were totally controlled by government state armed forces and intelligence personnel were assigned control over those areas if any violence erupted violent act done the control of rajapaksha regime was responsible as i explained the initial steps to suppress our political movement was taken by abducting comrades lalith and kuhan most of our comrades including me were followed by intelligence agents and the hunt on me ended up on th april by abducting me at kiribathgoda this incident was a clear evidence for the repression and life threat experienced by me that caused my leaving the country however local and international pressure and the mediation by australian government resulted in releasing me i did not know where i was taken and i never know the place i was held probably it was a location close to colombo having abducted by an illegal armed group i was on the edge of death abduction was illegal but i was deported legally through kaunayaka international airport unknown killers initiated the abduction but lankan police intervened in the action at the end of the process who would realize the combination who solve this puzzle abduction not known and expulsion administered by policeit happened like this i was blindfolded and pushed into the colombo crime division at dematagoda then onwards the legal action continues then only the australian high commisioner and first secretary appear and they followed me to katunayaka airport to make sure my safe departure recently former secretary to the defense ministry made a wonderful statement when i was watching the television in the kegalle remand prison a certain tv channel telecasted his statement taken from a web site in his statement former defense secretary said that neighbours of kiribathgoda informed them about a person and then the person was arrested who was responsible what was the police involved any documents related to arresting no nothing is there no legal process was followed and he admitted the incident took place he did reveal something else which slipped from his mouth he said that then jvp leaders supported the abduction helped to identify me in photographs and described physical featureshaving born in this town studied in the schools here and played in the playgrounds i was accused as if a foreigner this i believe is definitely a result of the leftist politics i was involved the shift of the jvp politics and the leadership role in the struggle to correct it is definitely the reason of my going abroadhonourable judgeand i do not believe that this capitalist state be able to solve the serious problems such as exploitation of labour and the division among haves and have nots this capitalist regime is unable to solve any socio economic problems according to our belief police courts prisons armed forces education and media are the very components of the capitalist state they are to ensure the existence and defence of the capitalist state there are so many good people who are humane in their personal capacity but they are compelled to ensure the existence of the system by serving the institutions and protecting the law and orderhonourable judgethe problem faced by me is the problem of democracy and social life in this country during the recent past specially the rajapaksha regime was accused of anti democratic practice a chain of abduction torture and assassination was a culture administered by them we all know that now there is yahapalana government which pledged to restore democracy and ensure justice for those crimes done by rajapaksha regime it is doing nothing but organize media events i believe instead of following a political agenda they are not focusing on restoring democratic rights i have suspicions of their intentions about making a so called democratic changes there was a loud noise about restoring democracy in the unp government came to power using the same kind of slogans accusing the former government about crimes done in suppressing struggle then in pa government could come to power by making use of democratic struggle accusations were held against unp regarding the cruelty of suppressing struggle recently yahapalana government came to power as a result of the social protest against the repressive rajapaksha regime but after the coming to power the present leaders are not attentive about restoring democratic rights this has been the continuous process the question faced by kumar gunaratnam is also a part of this whole question of democracy denied i have always asked myself whether the framework of legal process or within this court would my question be solvedmy belief is the question of my citizenship is not a legal issue but a decision to be taken by political authorities somebody might ask what did you do to gain citizenship according to the legal framework earlier in having requested i was not given visa it was the same controller of emigration and immigration was in office having rejected my visa applications he wanted me to produce a request letter which was not the normal practice i clearly explained in that letter the political nature for my coming here then he agreed to grant visa on the st of january i landed in katunayaka airport having entered the country on the st of january i applied for extension of visa period which was never responded on the nd of february i filed an application in the supreme court to restore my traditional citizenship the response was that the political authority must take decisions on that then on th february i sent a request to the minister of internal affairs requesting my traditional citizenship according to the article in the citizenship act it was no accepted and returned to me after the experiences of my engagements within the legal framework it is clear that political leadership must take decisions regarding my problem so it is a decision to be taken by the minister of the subject or the governmentlately on the january the attorney general has sent me a letter changing the early position as stated in writing he has instructed the controller of emigration and immigration to accept my application requesting the citizenship in one hand the the decision is to be taken by the political authority and on the other hand government officials such as controller of emigration and immigration and attorney general are changing their positions with regard to same question so there is a political nature apparent in this question one thing is acceptable that each and every state bodies public offices are highly politicized police officers those who arrested me have stated contradictory information about revealing my identity once they said the arresting was done as a result of inability to prove my identity but i am sure they arrested me as they knew who i am i know in police armed forces and public offices there may be officers with human values but they are compelled to act according to given instructions to protect existing orderso my question is to be solved by political authority it is a reflection of the crisis of democracy and it is explained that i was compelled to leave the country as a result of my political involvementhonourable judgenotwithstanding the fact that in which country be i able to live i would never abandon my leftist principles i pledge to the people of this country having continued in the left political career for years i would continue so with strength and faithfulness i mean by strength here the logical and philosophical position in which it is explained that this system cannot solve problems of oppressed people when i say faithfulness it is my conscience aligned with the comrades those who have sacrificed in the struggle for socialismto conclude i accept that my question would be solved along with the struggle for justice and true democracy so i pledge to continuously involve myself in that struggle thank you you honour for granting me opportunity for my statement

un high commissioner for human rights zeid raad al hussein concluding his four day visit to sri lanka said the prime ministers recent statements that nearly all the disappeared persons are dead has created great distress among their families he urged the government to quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining securityrelated detaineesfurther the un rights chief said the countrys justice system has become highly politicised unbalanced unreliable the countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures virtually all sri lankans recognise this and the prime minister commented on it at great length and with admirable candour during a january debate in parliamentfurther hussein said it is for these reasons that the report and the human rights council resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides this is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems i mentioned earlier but it is only one aspect albeit a very important one of the broad range of measures outlined in the un report and resolution and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate in sri lanka in recent days is unfortunate extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of sri lankas conflict and they should not be allowed to undermine the countrys long term chances of recovery once again the full statement is as follows i come to you shortly after wrapping up my visit here with meetings with president maithripala sirisena and prime minister ranil wickremesinghe and the leader of the opposition in which we discussed a wide range of issues that will have an important bearing on the future of sri lanka since arriving here on saturday i have also met the ministers of foreign affairs justice national dialogue and prison reforms rehabilitation and resettlement as well as the defence secretary chief of defence staff army and air force commanders and the chief of staff of the navyin addition here in colombo i visited the human rights commission of sri lanka and the task force that will lead the forthcoming national consultations on transitional justice i also met a number of sri lankas finest thinkers and analysts including members of its vibrant civil society organizationson sunday i visited the northern and eastern provinces where i met the chief ministers and members of the provincial councils as well as the governors and yesterday morning i was honoured to visit the revered sri dalada maligawa or temple of the sacred tooth in kandy where i was graciously received by the mahanayakas chief monks of the malwatte and asgiriya chapters i am very grateful to them for according me this great privilege as well as to the members of the hindu muslim and christian communities i met in colombo jaffna and trincomaleethis has been a much more friendly cooperative and encouraging visit than the one my predecessor endured in august which as you may recall was marred by vituperative attacks on her integrity simply because she addressed a number of burning human rights issues that any high commissioner for human rights would have raised at that timei am aware that some of the same people have given me a similar welcome ive seen the posters but i am pleased that in the new environment in sri lanka all voices including the moderate voices of civil society can at last be heard even if sometimes the voices of hatred and bigotry are still shouting the loudest and as a result are perhaps being listened to more than they deservesri lanka has come a long way in the past year as you the media are only too aware given the much greater freedom you now have to write what you wish to write and report what you feel you should report the element of fear has considerably diminished at least in colombo and the south in the north and the east it has mutated but sadly still existsvirtually everyone agrees there has been progress although opinions differ markedly about the extent of that progress the white van abductions that operated outside all norms of law and order and as intended instilled fear in the hearts of journalists human rights defenders and others who dared criticise the government or state security institutions are now very seldom reported the number of torture complaints has been reduced but new cases continue to emerge as two recent reports detailing some disturbing alleged cases that occurred in have shown and police all too often continue to resort to violence and excessive forceseveral recent highly symbolic steps have been taken that have had a positive impact on intercommunal relations including the decision taken to sing the national anthem in both sinhala and tamil on independence day for the first time since the early s the following day in a reciprocal gesture the chief minister of the northern province paid a respectful visit to a buddhist temple in jaffna and in january the president pardoned the convicted ltte prisoner who once plotted to assassinate him these are significant steps on the path of reconciliation between these two communities both of which bear their own deep scars from the years of conflict i was pleased to learn that some major inter communal events are planned in the north and east to bring together large numbers of young people from all across sri lanka in both provinces the governors are now civilians which is another key improvementone of the most important longterm achievements over the past year has been the restoration of the legitimacy and independence of sri lankas human rights commission the appointment of new leadership of great integrity through the proper constitutional process offers a new start to revitalise this allimportant national institution i hope the government will now swiftly provide it with the resources and above all the institutional respect it needs to enable it to fulfil its great potential not only to provide human rights protection for all sri lankans but also to offer expert advice on laws and policies from a human rights perspectivedespite these advances and others i have not mentioned after nearly years of conflict and acrimony that not only cost tens of thousands of lives but also eroded so many vital components of the state sri lanka is still in the early stages of renewalduring this visit i have met sinhalese muslim and tamil victims of the ruthless ltte and other paramilitary groups family members of those who were assassinated mothers of children who were abducted or recruited muslims from the north who were forcibly evicted and expelled from their homes mothers of soldiers who never returned and some of the many thousands of war widows from both sides i am all too conscious of the suffering and fear that the years of bombings killings and other abuses inflicted on this societyi also met the mothers and wives of people who were apprehended or surrendered to the security forces and then disappeared i have met relatives of people who have been in detention for years without being charged with any crime or who were charged solely on the basis of allegedly forced confessions i met one woman carrying the emotional scars of her rape by security forces nearly years ago during the jvp insurgency her pain and that of all these victims and their families is terrible to behold and it is cruel to prolong it if ways of alleviating it are availabledistracted by this conflict sri lanka has also failed to address critical issues facing women people with disabilities people with different sexual orientations and other groups suffering discrimination such as the plantation tamils in central sri lanka i hope that these and other neglected or discriminatedagainst groups and minorities will now receive the attention they deserve not least in the constitutional reform processrepairing the damage done by a protracted conflict is a task of enormous complexity and the early years are crucial if mistakes are made or significant problems are downplayed or ignored during the first few years they become progressively harder to sort out as time goes on while the glass is still molten if you are quick and skilful you can shape it into a fine object that will last for years once it starts to harden in misshapen form it becomes more and more difficult to rectify likewise if any of the four key elements of post conflict resolution truthtelling accountability reparations and institutional reform are neglected or mishandled unresolved resentments will fester new strains will emerge and a tremendous opportunity to establish longterm stability which in turn should result in greater prosperity will be lostin the case of sri lanka large parts of the country have been physically politically socially and economically separated from each other to a greater or lesser degree for much of the past three decades and the effort to rebuild trust in the state and between communities will take years of political courage determination and skilled coordination and planningwhen you visit colombo you see a bustling city a mass of construction sites clean streets and flourishing businesses you see a thriving tourist industrywhen you visit the north and the east you see in patches at least damaged and depressed areas poverty and continued displacement signs of physical development certainly and positive vision and ambitions among the elected representatives but also more ominous signs of hopes that are not yet bearing fruit and optimism that is already showing some signs of souringwhile there is much support for the very important proposed constitutional reform which should ensure that the rights of all sri lankans are fully recognised there are also fears that at a later stage this may be achieved at the expense of other equally important processes such as truthtelling justice and accountabilitywhile the task force appointed to lead the national consultation process includes high quality representatives of civil society there are concerns including among the taskforce members themselves that the process is too rushed and has not been properly planned or adequately resourcedthere are some measures that could be taken quickly which would reverse this trend of draining confidence first of all the military needs to accelerate the return of land it has seized and is still holding to its rightful owners while some land has been returned in the jaffna and trincomalee areas there are still large tracts which can and should be swiftly given back once the land has been given back the remaining communities of displaced people can if given the necessary assistance return home and a lingering sore will have been cured once and for all in parallel the size of the military force in the north and the east can be reduced to a level that is less intrusive and intimidating as a first step in security sector reformthe government must also quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining securityrelated detainees in addition the prime ministers recent statement that nearly all the disappeared persons are dead has created great distress among their families who until then still had hope this statement must be followed by rapid action to identify precisely who is still alive and who has died or been killed properly account for their deaths including whether or not they were unlawful identify the location of their remains and provide redresshigh on the agenda in every meeting i have had here of course were issues relating to the implementation of the resolution adopted by the un human rights council on october last year a resolution that was cosponsored by sri lanka and agreed with the consensus of all member states of the council the resolution laid out an eminently sensible pathway for the country to follow and my office was charged with following up on its implementation including by reporting back to the council on progress or lack of it next june and again in march the human rights council resolution and the comprehensive report on which it was based and which it endorsed aim to promote reconciliation accountability and human rights the release of the report and the ensuing resolution unleashed a great surge of hope that finally we were all turning a corner in terms of starting to fully recognise what happened during the final years of sri lankas hugely corrosive and tragic conflictthe human rights council resolution was in many ways a reflection of the reform agenda that sri lankans had voted for in last years presidential and parliamentary elections it sets out some of the tough steps that must be taken to achieve reconciliation and accountability and through them lasting peacethere are many myths and misconceptions about the resolution and what it means for sri lanka it is not a gratuitous attempt to interfere with or undermine the countrys sovereignty or independence it is not some quasicolonial act by some nebulous foreign power the acceptance of the resolution was a moment of strength not weakness by sri lanka it was the countrys commitment to both itself and to the world to confront the past honestly and by doing that take out comprehensive insurance against any future devastating outbreak of inter communal tensions and conflictthe world wants sri lanka to be a success story it has seen the opportunity for lasting success in sri lanka and that is why it has invested so much time and energy into providing that pathway laid down in last octobers human rights council resolution i urge all sri lankans to make an effort to understand what that resolution and the report underpinning it actually say and i urge all those in a position to do so to make a greater effort to explain why the recommendations are so important and why the united nations and all those individual states sri lanka included endorsed them then perhaps the siren voices who wish to undermine all reforms all attempts to provide justice accountability and reconciliation will get less traction the people who are trying to undermine confidence in these crucial initiatives are playing a game that is endangering the future peace and stability of this countryfor a country to be stable to be a success it needs to have a strong impartial and credible justice system the security services and the judiciary must function in the interests of all its citizens and it was in these areas that the countrys key institutions were seriously corroded and corrupted during three decades of conflict and human rights violations including through its reliance on the draconian prevention of terrorism act and other emergency powers and it is the integrity of these institutions which depends on having the trust of the population that the international community is trying hard to help sri lanka restore through the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report and in the resolutionsri lanka has many excellent judges lawyers and law enforcement officials but over the years the system they depended on and which depends on them became highly politicised unbalanced unreliable the countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures virtually all sri lankans recognise this and the prime minister commented on it at great length and with admirable candour during a january debate in parliament virtually every week provides a new story of a failed investigation a mob storming a courtroom or another example of a crime going unpunished sexual violence and harassment against women and girls is particularly poorly handled by the relevant state institutions especially when the alleged perpetrators are members of the military or security services and as a result it remains all too widespreadit is for these reasons that the report and the human rights council resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides this is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems i mentioned earlier but it is only one aspect albeit a very important one of the broad range of measures outlined in the un report and resolution and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate in sri lanka in recent days is unfortunate extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of sri lankas conflict and they should not be allowed to undermine the countrys long term chances of recovery once againonly a year ago large numbers of sri lankans voted for change for reconciliation for truth for justice it would be a great shame if a minority of extreme voices on both sides who are bent on disruption were allowed to prevail by creating fear where there should be hope sri lanka needs a serious debate about these very serious issues on which its future depends this needs to start with a thorough frank and honest discussion of the detailed findings of the september un report as it is important that all sri lankans rally behind the process and better understand the point of view of all the victims on all sidesthe government has shown the will to make great changes but from the victims in the north and in the east and also from some of the wisest analysts here in colombo i have heard fears that the government may be wavering on its human rights commitments i was therefore reassured this morning to hear both the president and the prime minister state their firm conviction in this regardlet me make it as plain as i can the international community wants to welcome sri lanka back into its fold without any lingering reservations it wants to help sri lanka become an economic powerhouse it wants sri lankas armed forces to face up to the stain on their reputation so that they can once again play a constructive role in international peacekeeping operations and command the full respect that so many of their members deservebut for all that to come to fruition sri lanka must confront and defeat the demons of its past it must create institutions that work and ensure accountability it must seize the great opportunity it currently has

former president mahinda rajapaksa today called upon the sri lankan public to unite and resist the attempt by the government to betray the country and the war heroes following the assurance given to the un human rights commissioner that last years un human rights council resolution against sri lanka will be implemented i am profoundly saddened to see that a section slfp has also joined the unp in this great betrayalhaving accepted the geneva resolution the government is now adopting various strategies to convince the public that it will not be harmful to the country we saw the president and prime minister in recent days expressing to the international media what seemed to be contradictory views on the participation of foreign judges in the proposed war crimes mechanismfull statement released from his office as followsthe president and prime minister have given the un human rights commissioner an assurance that last years un human rights council resolution against sri lanka will be implemented this unhrc resolution was accepted and cosponsored by the sri lankan government and passed by the unhrc without a vote the unp led government accepted the geneva resolution with the same carelessness with which they entered into the ceasefire agreement with the ltte in though our ambassador in geneva tried to negotiate different terms that was deliberately stopped by the government which insisted on accepting the us sponsored resolution just as it was there is now an attempt to portray this unhrc resolution as a great diplomatic victory for sri lanka but in reality it was a great betrayal comparable to the kandyan convention of the people should once again be reminded about what exactly has been undertaken by accepting this resolution in operative paragraphs and the present government has accepted the report of the office of the high commissioner on human rights which said that war crimes including the killing of civilians torture and the deliberate starvation of people had been committed by our armed forces and they have agreed to set up a war crimes tribunal manned by foreign judges prosecutors and investigators and funded directly from overseas to try our war heroes for these alleged crimes furthermore they have agreed to remove through administrative action members of the armed forces who are suspected of having committed war crimes but against whom there isnt enough evidence to place before the war crimes tribunal they have also agreed to make amendments to the public security ordinance and to repeal the prevention of terrorism actin operative paragraphs and the government has undertaken to devolve power in order to bring about a political settlement sri lanka and to do everything undertaken in the resolution under the supervision of the office of the high commissioner on human rights ohchr it should be borne in mind that the ohchr that has come in for heavy criticism by the un human rights council itself the unhrc passes every year with more than a two thirds majority a resolution calling upon the ohchr to end the domination of that office by westerners and to reduce its dependency on western funds the government has thus agreed to place sri lanka under the supervision of an institution that is facing criticism by the unhrc itself for its western biashaving accepted the geneva resolution the government is now adopting various strategies to convince the public that it will not be harmful to the country we saw the president and prime minister in recent days expressing to the international media what seemed to be contradictory views on the participation of foreign judges in the proposed war crimes mechanism but this was just a drama for public consumption it became clear from the presidents independence day speech that there is no difference in the stands taken by him and the prime minister on the geneva resolution the president not only endorsed the decision of the government to implement the geneva resolution but also accused those opposed to it of misleading the public he further said in his independence day speech that the implementation of the geneva resolution will only result in promoting democracy reconciliation and respect for our armed forcesthe war was won by an slfp government led by me it is a matter of profound regret to me that our party has been subordinated in this manner to the unp which tried to sabotage the war effort at every turn many would recall the manner in which the unp even tried to stop the war by defeating the government at the budget vote in when that did not work members of the unp ridiculed the war effort by saying among other things that any ox can fight a war and that while claiming to be advancing on alimankada the army was actually moving towards pamankada it is not surprising to see such people now trying to exact revenge from those who won the warhowever i am profoundly saddened to see that a section slfp has also joined the unp in this great betrayal the unp may be deriving a great deal of satisfaction by thus getting a section of the slfp which won the war to underwrite every traitorous they commit i call upon the people of sri lanka to unite and resist this attempt by the government to betray the country and our war heroes

former president mahinda rajapaksa today said in a statement that there is a clear concerted effort on the part of the united national party unp to destroy the sri lanka freedom party slfp completely slfp members in the government should decide which is more important to them the unp led government or the slfp through which they were elected last august to represent the people on an antiunp antigovernment platform he saidhe noted that when president maithripala sirisena took over the position of slfp chairman it was expected that he would look after the party rank and file uphold party policies and protect the identity of the slfp even though he was elected president on unp votes regrettably that has not happenedthe full statement released from his office as followsi take pride in the fact that i built the strongest slfp government in our partys history during my tenure in power that government was so strong that it could be defeated only by conspiratorially creating divisions in the party and a section of the slfp joining the unp in its campaign of vilification and false propaganda against my government the unp by itself was in no position to defeat the slfp government that i built even after the defeat of my government the president of the country is the present leader of the slfp the cabinet is equally divided between the unp and the slfp in what has been called a national unity government yet the policy of this government is decided by the unp resulting in a situation where the slfp has been held captive and forced to follow the unp line the slfp is now in danger of losing its identity as a political partydemonstrations by farmers against the abolition of the fertiliser subsidy have now become a daily occurrence the presidents order to fix the price of a bag of fertiliser at rs will be about as effective as the price controls on dhal and dried fish an slfp government would never have abolished the fertiliser subsidy which was one of the main incentives to cultivate paddy yet when the unp government abolished this production subsidy the slfp members in the government had to endorse that decisionprofessional groups in this country have been agitating against the decision of the unp government to sign an economic and technological cooperation agreement with india the unp prime minister says that he will go ahead with the agreement regardless of the opposition to it during my government too a similar agreement styled cepa proposed by india was under discussion but we had to reconsider it after giving due consideration to opposition from sri lankan stakeholders today the slfp members in the government have no option but to silently consent to the arbitrary actions of the unpthe unp government accepted and adopted as their own the american sponsored unhrc resolution against sri lanka which betrayed our armed forces and the country by agreeing to institute a war crimes court with the participation of foreign judges prosecutors and investigators while slfp members of the government stood by helplessly it was an slfp government led by me that won the war against the ltte today the unp with the acquiescence of a section of the slfp is engaged in exacting revenge from those who won the war against all oddsthe budget had no slfp characteristics at all and was based on the unps neoliberal economic outlook it sought among other things to privatize every government owned enterprise including the norochcholai power plant and the operations of all harbours and airports it also sought to abolish the government pension for new recruits to the public service the fertiliser subsidy and free school uniforms programme yet the slfp members serving in the government had to vote for this budgetslfp members who have stood up against this capitulation and have tried to maintain the identity of the party have been penalised several slfp electoral organisers prasanna ranatunga dilum amunugama kanthi kodikara dhanasiri amaratunga duminda silva and senarath jayasundera among others have been removed from their positions the two parliamentarians among them prasanna ranatunga and dilum amunugama sat in the opposition and played a major role in protecting the identity of the slfp both inside and outside parliament members of our party should ask themselves as to whose interests are served by removing such parliamentarians from their positions as electoral organisers apart from all this members of the slfp in the government have had to stand by and watch while their colleagues serving in the opposition are systematically vilified as rogues and murderers and dragged before police investigative bodies commissions of inquiry and the courtsthere clearly is a concerted effort on the part of the unp to destroy the slfp completely slfp members in the government should decide which is more important to them the unp led government or the slfp through which they were elected last august to represent the people on an antiunp antigovernment platform when president maithripala sirisena took over the position of slfp chairman it was expected that he would look after the party rank and file uphold party policies and protect the identity of the slfp even though he was elected president on unp votes regrettably that has not happened

foreign office minister for asia hugo swire who is on an official visit to sri lanka addressed the council for business with britain alongside sri lankas deputy minister of state enterprise development eran wickramaratne todayfollowing is the text of the speech delivered by mr swire to the council honourable deputy minister wickramaratne mr shirendra lawrence chairman of the council for business with britain ladies and gentlemenit is an honour to address such a distinguished audience and i thank you for your warm welcomei am delighted to be back in sri lanka and i want to take this opportunity to share my thoughts on the exciting prospects for this country and for the political and economic ties between sri lanka and the united kingdomwhat a difference a year makes since the election of president sirisena last january there has been a distinct and welcome change of atmosphere in the bilateral relationship between our two countriesi was delighted to be the first overseas minister to visit sri lanka following the presidential elections and our ties have gone from strength to strength most notably when president sirisena met her majesty the queen and prime minister david cameron in london in marchand i think this improvement in relations is largely down to the positive developments we have seen in sri lanka over this remarkable yearfor me perhaps the most significant of these developments were the commitments sri lanka made at the human rights council in september those commitments to take meaningful steps towards truth and accountability after the long conflict here are key to bringing about lasting reconciliationand that is important because it is reconciliation that will i believe be the bedrock on which sri lankas future economic success will be builtthat is why in recognition of these commitments and following talks between prime minister david cameron and president sirisena at the commonwealth heads of government meeting in malta in december we were delighted to announce the provision of million pounds of uk government funding to support peace and reconciliation in sri lankaincidentally let me also mention another significant announcement coming out of that meeting the appointment of a nonresident uk defence adviser historically our bilateral military relations have been very close and i know that the resumption of cooperation and collaboration in this field is very welcome by the armed forces of both our countriesi will be going to the north tomorrow with the president and sri lankan prime minister wickremesinghe to participate in national thai pongal celebrations celebrations that have even more powerful meaning at this time of new beginnings for sri lankaand while there i also look forward to meeting resettled families members of civil society and religious leaders to hear directly from them about the progress in reconciliation and economic developmentone vital aspect of reconciliation and economic development and a growing area of cooperation between the uk and sri lanka is tackling corruption this was of course a key election promise of president sirisena and answering his request for international assistance the uk is providing anticorruption training and antibribery expertise to the sri lankan authoritieswhy are we doing that because the elimination of corruption improves business confidence not only for the existing business community but it also helps make sri lanka a destination of choice for new foreign direct investmentthat is good for the uk as well as for sri lanka because building our prosperity through increasing exports and investment opening markets ensuring access to resources and promoting sustainable global growth is a key element of the uk governments long term economic plan and a cornerstone our foreign policythe latest figures released in december show the uk economy continued to grow strongly with gdp in q increasing on a year ago the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate in nearly ten years while average wages and productivity measured by hour worked continued to growhowever both our countries cannot afford to be complacentwe are only two weeks into the new year and already weve had worrying news about stock market falls around the world the slowdown in china deep problems in brazil and in russiacommodity prices have fallen very significantlyoil which was over a barrel in dipped below earlier this weekthat is good for consumers and business customers both in britain and sri lanka but bad news for the oil and gas industry worrying for the creditors who have lent to it and a massive problem for the countries that depend on itand all of it adds to the volatility and sense of uncertainty in the worldhowever through its actions the government of sri lanka has sent a very clear message to the international community across the world that it is open for business from all corners of the globe attracting foreign direct investment is i know a top priority for the government as it seeks to strengthen the sri lankan economy and put sri lanka in a stronger position to deal with the global challenges both our countries faceand i am pleased to report that the past year has been a very busy one for the high commission trade and investment team with their support british companies are now competing for around billion of business across a range of sectors we are hopeful that many will be successful in a transparent and accountable competitive bidding processi was also pleased that the lord mayor of the city of london visited in may many of you may have met him while he was here promoting the city of london as a hub of global financial excellence and fostering closer links with the colombo stock exchangethe uk also continues to be among the top investors in sri lanka and i am delighted that around companies in sri lanka with a uk affiliation currently operate here i hope and expect that that those numbers will continue to riseon exports the uk is sri lankas third largest market with exports in growing a remarkable to well over billion while british exports to sri lanka were only million in the same year we have made reducing that trade gap a priority and the latest figures show uk exports to sri lanka increased by nearly last yearbut while this is all good progress we are not resting on our laurels next week for example the high commission is hosting a food is great event highlighting the excellence of british food and drinkand i hope you have secured your tickets for the marco pierre white gala dinner to taste the finest produce from all over the uksadly i shall not be there but i am sure the high commissioner will enjoy telling me what i missedafter that the team here will be hosting a multisectoral trade mission in february to further bolster our bilateral trading linksi will end there and take some questions in a moment but to summarise it is clear from the steps that sri lankas government has taken so far that it is serious about delivering on the commitments it has made on accountability and reconciliation addressing problems from the past will create the right conditions for greater prosperity in the futureit is equally clear that the administration is serious about tackling corruption and attracting the investment it needs to deliver longterm sustainable growththe british government is proud to help in any way we can and i am pleased that british businesses are contributing to sri lankas success i am confident that when i next visit i will hear about more british companies winning business and doing business herei am in no doubt that this will be thanks in no small part to the valuable work of the council for business with britain shirendra thank you for all the help and support you give to the high commission in its trade promotion activitiesby working together the council and the british and sri lankan governments are making great strides in bringing security and prosperity to the people of sri lanka of the united kingdom and of the wider worldso i am of the firm view that the prospects for our
